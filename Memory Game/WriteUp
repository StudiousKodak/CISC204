Write up-

The program ran as expected, with a score counter, restart button, and resetting of the cards if a match is not made. It functions smoothly and
could be played infinately. Overall I ran into issues trying to pair a TextMeshPro instead of a Text Mesh Legacy and that is the reason why my submission
is late. If there is anything I could improve or missed, I will happily resubmit. Thank you!
