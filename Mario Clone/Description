The controls are as follows, "w" moves forward, "s" moves backwards, "a" moves left, "d" moves right
The mouse/trackpad is used to aim the camera, and the speed has been toned down 

The setting is essentially a box, with 4 interior walls colored pink. There is nothing to do inside of the box, however the walls are nice to look at.
Oh and we made gravity.
