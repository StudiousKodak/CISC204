This project is a simple 2D game... nothing resembles Mario but I like to think
of 2D games as a base game of mario platformers, with a twist.

In this program, we have a basic animated spritemap of a stickfigure with both
idle and cycle animations.
A level to explore, we used a simple floor, box, and 2 moving platforms.

The basis of this game is to jump from the box and stay on a moving platform for as
long as possible, however no other obsticales or countes have been implemented,
however that is something I would like to revise in the future.

You begin on the middle of a platform in the abyss, with a box and two flying platforms.
You start action by trying to jump on the box to then get bumped down by one of the flying
platforms. You realize you need to time the jump to get on top of the box and after a few 
tries (or spamming the spacebar) you succeed... Congrats! But then you get pushed off by the
same platform, that was short lived. So you jump back on the box and make it onto the platform!
Now to the next platform, but you just cant jump that far on the first try. You proceed to
repeat until you make it! Congrats you made the hardest jump!

Its very simple and bare bones but a very good starting point to begin building off of with
other assests and more offical counters and even mutiple levels!
